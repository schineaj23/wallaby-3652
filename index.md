## Botball 2018 Project Base

The puropse of this code is to
have a project base for Botball. This code is being maintained and updated actively most likely up until the end of the Botball 2018 season, although this will still be used as a project base by Parkside Robotics until further stated.

### Features

- Basic Movement and Veering
- Edge Tracking
- Line Tracking
- Camera Operations and Algorithims
- Motor Tracking and Sensing
- Drawing Logic and Functions

### Simplicity

The PKMS Framework is Customizable without sacrificing simplicity.
All features are as simple as calling a function! No need to link a .lib simply add the files!
For example, a line tracking program.

```c
#include "chassis.h"

int main()
{ 
    trackLine();

    return 0;
}
```
